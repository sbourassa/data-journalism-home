<h3>Pitch 1: Why did these states become drastically happier or more depressed in the past year?</h3>

<p>Looking at the data from <a href="http://bit.ly/1o6ik3J" target="_blank">Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index for 2013</a>, there are at least five states (Nevada, Wyoming, North Dakota, Alaska and Connecticut) that drastically changed in their rankings over the past year. I am interested in finding out why these states changed. This is newsworthy because the results were released this month and though there has been media coverage about the happiest and least happiest states according to the report, there has not been coverage about why these states drastically changed in rankings.</p> 

<p>I would need to compare the state's 2012 and 2013 rankings. I would want to pull the rankings from both year's reports and use Excel to sort and calculate which had the greatest change in score from the past year. I would then compare the domain categories of each (life evaluation, emotional health, work environment, physical health, healthy behaviors and basic access) to figure out why they changed. Based on the findings, I would further research what changed in those areas.</p> 

<p>I would want to interview a contact from <a href="http://bit.ly/1frS3h4" target="_blank">Gallup-Healthways</a> as well as experts from the states I examine (Nevada, Wyoming, North Dakota, Alaska and Connecticut) in the areas that most changed (such as a psychiatrist if emotional health was a key factor).</p> 

<p>I would like to create a slideshow (one slide for each state), showing the information through a chart or infographic and text explaining the results.</p> 

<p>I would need to learn how to scrape data from the 2012 and 2013 reports as well as how to create the slideshow and chart or infographic. I could pitch to local publications of the states mentioned in the article as well as national publications with strong health coverage, such as the Huffington Post.</p> 

<p>*As a possible add-on, it would be interesting to create an interactive quiz telling the user which state they should live in depending on what is most important to them (work environment, physical activity, etc.).</p>

<h3>Pitch 2: What state has the most medical marijuana users? Does this help indicate who will legalize marijuana next?</h3>

<p>As marijuana is legal in Colorado and Washington, now 19 states and the District of Columbia are discussing legalization bills and ballot measures and 24 states are looking at creating or expanding medical-marijuana program, according to <a href="http://bit.ly/1cnlJ95" target="_blank">Mother Jones</a>. This subject is a hot topic in the media, but I have not seen a recent breakdown of medical marijuana users by state. It would be interesting to compare the number of medical marijuana users per population in 2013 for each state (including a breakdown of their gender and ages) and see how this correlates to the state's current marijuana polices. For example, did Colorado and Washington have more medical marijuana users than other states? Could this be an indication of which states will likely legalize marijuana next?</p>

<p>I would need to compare the population of each state from the <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1bxgDVY" target="_blank">U.S. Census Bureau</a> with the number of medical marijuana users for the <a href="http://bit.ly/1frNcX8" target="_blank">20 states that have legalized medical</a> use. I would be able to find the number of users on the state's government website as well as a breakdown of gender and ages. For example, here is the data for <a href="http://1.usa.gov/1fU9CRz" target="_blank">Colorado</a>.</p> 

<p>I would use Excel to sort and filter the data and calculate the number of users per population. I may need to learn to scrape the data, or I could manually visit the state's websites.</p>

<p>I would like to create an interactive map showing the findings, including gender and age. I would discuss the findings and trends in infographics or an article (ex.: more men than women are medical marijuana users). I would need to learn how to create the interactive map and infographics.</p>

<p>I would like to talk to state health departments as well as medical marijuana doctors. I would pitch this to local publications in Colorado and Washington, such as the Denver Post and Seattle Times. I could also pitch to Mother Jones and health sections of national media outlets.</p>

<h3>Pitch 3: Which cosmetic plastic surgery has gained the most popularity in the last year? Which has significantly declined in popularity?</h3> 

<p>According to the <a href="http://bit.ly/1frSSX6" target="_blank">2013 Cosmetic Surgery Plastic Statistics</a>, the number of calf augmentation procedures grew the most and lip reduction significantly declined. I want to find out why this is and what this may say culturally.</p>  

<p>This is newsworthy because the 2013 report was just released, and there is not much media coverage or data visualizations to help understand the significant changes of these plastic surgeries in the past year.</p>

<p>I would want to show the change in numbers in a chart or infographic, which I would need to learn how to create. I would also write an article about why this is and the cultural implications based on interviews with the <a href="http://bit.ly/1cQysV2" target="_blank">American Society of Plastic Surgeons</a>, plastic surgeons as well as people who have experienced the procedures.</p> 

<p>I would pitch to women's health publications, such as Women's Health, or publications that have a strong healthy living section, such as the Huffington Post.</p>
