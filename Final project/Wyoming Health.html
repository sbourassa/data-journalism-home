<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Looking at the data from <a href="http://bit.ly/1o6ik3J" target="_blank">Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index for 2013</a>, Wyoming is the state that decreased the most in its rankings over the past year (from No. 13 in 2012 to No. 34 in 2013). I am interested in finding out why Wyoming drastically changed. This is newsworthy because the results were released last month, and though there has been media coverage about the happiest and saddest states according to the report, there has not been coverage about why Wyoming or other states drastically changed in rankings.</p>

<p>I would need to compare the 2012 and 2013 scores of Wyoming's domain categories (life evaluation, emotional health, work environment, physical health, healthy behaviors and basic access). I would want to pull the scores from both year's reports and use Excel to sort and calculate which had the greatest change in score from the past year. Based on the findings, I would further research what changed in those areas. I may also look at Wyoming's scores in previous years to see if I can find any trends.</p>

<h3>Sources</h3>

<p>I would want to interview a contact from <a href="http://bit.ly/1frS3h4" target="_blank">Gallup-Healthways</a> as well as experts from Wyoming in the areas that most changed, such as the <a href="http://www.health.wyo.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank">Wyoming Department of Health</a> and the <a href="http://wyomingworkforce.org/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Wyoming Department of Workforce Services</a>. 

<h3>Skills</h3>

<p>I would like to write an article and also create an interactive chart, showing how the five ranking systems for Wyoming have changed over the years.
I would need to learn how to scrape data from the 2012 and 2013 reports, or I could do this manually. I would also want to learn how to create the interactive chart.</p> 

<h3>Publications</h3>

<p>I could pitch to local Wyoming publications, such as the <a href="http://www.wyomingnews.com" target="_blank">Wyoming Tribune Eagle</a> , as well as national publications with strong health coverage, such as the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/" target="_blank">Huffington Post.</p>
